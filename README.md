# Bouncing Balls

Weekend project, for week 31 October to 1 Nov. I took a break from playing Red Dead redemption 2
to fire up my IDE and mess around with HTML5 canvas.

This project doesn't do anything at all. It just spawns a bunch of balls that bounch off walls.

You can see the project in action on my site [Bouncing Balls](https://code.musangeya.com/bouncing_balls) 

To run, just clone the repo, cd in and run npx serve

```
git clone git@github.com:phoexer/bouncing_balls.git
cd bouncing_balls
npx serve
```
